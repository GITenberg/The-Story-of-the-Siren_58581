<h2>THE STORY OF THE SIREN</h2></div>


<p>Few things have been more beautiful than my
note book on the Deist Controversy as it fell downward
through the waters of the Mediterranean. It dived,
like a piece of black slate, but opened soon, disclosing
leaves of pale green, which quivered into blue. Now it
had vanished, now it was a piece of magical india rubber
stretching out to infinity, now it was a book again, but
bigger than the book of all knowledge. It grew more
fantastic as it reached the bottom, where a puff of sand
welcomed it and obscured it from view. But it reappeared,
quite sane though a little tremulous, lying decently
open on its back, while unseen fingers fidgeted among
its leaves.</p>

<p>"It is such a pity" said my aunt, "that you will
not finish your work in the Hotel. Then you would
be free to enjoy yourself and this would never have
happened."</p>

<p>"Nothing of it but will change into something rich
and strange," warbled the chaplain, while his sister said
"Why it's gone into the water." As for the boatmen,
one of them laughed, while the other, without a word
of warning, stood up and began to take his clothes off.</p>

<p>"Holy Moses!" cried the Colonel. "Is the fellow
mad?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, thank him dear," said my aunt: "that is to
say tell him he is very kind, but perhaps another time."</p>

<p>"All the same I do want my book back," I complained.
"It's for my Fellowship Dissertation. There
won't be much left of it by another time."</p>

<p>"I have an idea," said some woman or other
through her parasol. "Let us leave this child of
nature to dive for the book while we go on to the other
grotto. We can land him either on this rock or on the
ledge inside, and he will be ready when we return."</p>

<p>The idea seemed good; and I improved it by saying
I would be left behind too, to lighten the boat. So
the two of us were deposited outside the little grotto
on a great sunlit rock that guarded the harmonies within.
Let us call them blue, though they suggest rather
the spirit of what is clean, cleanliness passed from the
domestic to the sublime, the cleanliness of all the sea
gathered together and radiating light. The Blue Grotto
at Capri contains only more blue water, not bluer water.
That colour and that spirit is the heritage of every cave
in the Mediterranean into which the sun can shine and
the sea flow.</p>

<p>As soon as the boat left I realised how imprudent
I had been to trust myself on a sloping rock with an
unknown Sicilian. With a jerk he became alive, seizing
my arm and saying "Go to the end of the Grotto
and I will show you something beautiful."</p>

<p>He made me jump off the rock on to the ledge
over a dazzling crack of sea, he drew me away from the
light till I was standing on the tiny beach of sand which
emerged like powdered turquoise at the further end.
There he left me with his clothes, and returned swiftly
to the summit of the entrance-rock. For a moment he
stood naked in the brilliant sun, looking down at the
spot where the book lay. Then he crossed himself,
raised his hands above his head, and dived.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>If the book was wonderful, the man is past all description.
His effect was that of a silver statue, alive
beneath the sea, through whom life throbbed in blue
and green. Something infinitely happy, infinitely wise&mdash;but
it was impossible that it should emerge from the
depths sunburnt and dripping, holding the note book
on the Deist Controversy between its teeth.</p>

<p>A gratuity is generally expected by those who bathe.
Whatever I offered, he was sure to want more, and I
was disinclined for an argument in a place so beautiful
and also so solitary. It was a relief that he should say
in conversational tones "In a place like this one might
see the Siren."</p>

<p>I was delighted with him for thus falling into the
key of his surroundings. We had been left together
in a magic world, apart from all the commonplaces that
are called reality, a world of blue whose floor was the
sea and whose walls and roof of rock trembled with the
sea's reflections. Here, only the fantastic would be tolerable,
and it was in that spirit that I echoed his words.
"One might easily see the Siren."</p>

<p>He watched me curiously while he dressed. I was
parting the sticky leaves of the note book as I sat on
the strip of sand.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he said at last. "You may have read the
little book that was printed last year. Who would have
thought that our Siren would have given the foreigners
pleasure!"</p>

<p>(I read it afterwards. Its account is, not unnaturally,
incomplete, in spite of there being a woodcut of
the young person, and the words of her song.)</p>

<p>"She comes out of this blue water, doesn't she,"
I suggested "and sits on the rock at the entrance, combing
her hair."</p>

<p>I wanted to draw him out, for I was interested in
his sudden gravity, and there was a suggestion of irony<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
in his last remark that puzzled me.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen her?"</p>

<p>"Often and often."</p>

<p>"I never."</p>

<p>"But you have heard her sing!"</p>

<p>He put on his coat and said impatiently, "How
can she sing under the water? Who could? She sometimes
tries, but nothing comes from her but great
bubbles."</p>

<p>"She should climb on to the rock then."</p>

<p>"How can she?" he cried again, quite angry.
"The priests have blessed the air, so she cannot breathe
it, and blessed the rocks, so that she cannot sit on them.
But the sea no man can bless, because it is too big, and
always changing. Therefore she lives in the sea."</p>

<p>I was silent.</p>

<p>At this his face took a gentler expression. He
looked at me as though something was on his mind,
and going out to the entrance rock, gazed at the external
blue. Then returning into our twilight he said "As
a rule only good people see the Siren."</p>

<p>I made no comment. There was a pause, and he
continued. "That is a very strange thing, and the priests
do not know how to account for it; for she of course
is wicked. Not only those who fast and go to mass
are in danger, but even those who are merely good in
daily life. No one in the village had seen her for two
generations. I am not surprised. We all cross ourselves
before we enter the water, but it is unnecessary.
Giuseppe, we thought, was safer than most. We loved
him, and many of us he loved: but that is a different
thing to being good."</p>

<p>I asked who Giuseppe was.</p>

<p>"That day&mdash;I was seventeen and my brother was
twenty and a great deal stronger than I was and it was
the year when the visitors, who have brought such pros<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>perity
and so many alterations into the village, first began
to come. One English lady in particular, of very
high birth, came, and has written a book about the place,
and it was through her that the Improvement Syndicate
was formed, which is about to connect the hotels with
the station by means of a Funicular railway."</p>

<p>"Don't tell me about that lady in here," I observed.</p>

<p>"That day we took her and her friends to see the
grottoes. As we rowed close under the cliffs I put out
my hand, as one does, and caught a little crab, and having
pulled off its claws offered it as a curiosity. The ladies
groaned, but a gentleman was pleased, and held out
money. Being inexperienced, I refused it, saying that
his pleasure was sufficient reward! Giuseppe, who was
rowing behind, was very angry with me and reached out
with his hand and hit me on the side of the mouth, so
that a tooth cut my lip, and I bled. I tried to hit him
back, but he always was too quick for me, and as I
stretched round he kicked me under the arm pit, so that
for a moment I could not even row. There was a great
noise among the ladies, and I heard afterwards that
they were planning to take me away from my brother
and train me as a waiter. That at all events never
came to pass.</p>

<p>"When we reached the grotto&mdash;not here, but a
larger one&mdash;the gentleman was very anxious that one
of us should dive for money, and the ladies consented,
as they sometimes do. Giuseppe who had discovered
how much pleasure it gives foreigners to see us in the
water, refused to dive for anything but silver, and the
gentleman threw in a two lira piece.</p>

<p>"Just before my brother sprang off he caught sight
of me holding my bruise, and crying, for I could not
help it. He laughed and said 'this time, at all events,
I shall not see the Siren!' and went into the blue water
without crossing himself. But he saw her."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>He broke off, and accepted a cigarette. I watched
the golden entrance rock and the quivering walls, and
the magic water through which great bubbles constantly
rose. At last he dropped his hot ash into the ripples
and turned his head away, and said:</p>

<p>"He came up without the coin. We pulled him
into the boat, and he was so large that he seemed to fill
it, and so wet that we could not dress him. I have
never seen a man so wet. I and the gentleman rowed
back, and we covered Giuseppe with sacking and
propped him up in the stern."</p>

<p>"He was drowned, then?" I murmured, supposing
that to be the point.</p>

<p>"He was not" he cried angrily. "He saw the
Siren. I told you."</p>

<p>I was silenced again.</p>

<p>"We put him to bed, though he was not ill. The
doctor came, and took money, and the priest came and
took more and smothered him with incense and spattered
him with holy water. But it was no good. He was
too big&mdash;like a piece of the sea. He kissed the thumb-bones
of San Biagio and they never dried till evening."</p>

<p>"What did he look like?" I ventured.</p>

<p>"Like anyone who has seen the Siren. If you
have seen her 'often and often' how is it you do not
know? Unhappy, unhappy, unhappy because he knew
everything. Every living thing made him unhappy
because he knew it would die. And all he cared to do
was to sleep."</p>

<p>I bent over my note book.</p>

<p>"He did no work, he forgot to eat, he forgot
whether he had his clothes on. All the work fell on
me, and my sister had to go out to service. We tried
to make him into a beggar, but he was too robust to
inspire pity, and as for an idiot, he had not the right
look in his eyes. He would stand in the street look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>ing
at people, and the more he looked at them the more
unhappy he became. When a child was born he would
cover his face with his hands. If anyone was married&mdash;he
was terrible then, and would frighten them as they
came out of church. Who would have believed he
would marry himself! I caused that, I. I was reading
out of the paper how a girl at Ragusa had 'gone
mad through bathing in the sea.' Giuseppe got up,
and in a week he and that girl came in together.</p>

<p>"He never told me anything, but it seems that he
went straight to her house, broke into her room, and
carried her off. She was the daughter of a rich mine-owner,
so you may imagine our peril. Her father came
down, with a clever lawyer, but they could do no more
than I. They argued and they threatened, but at last
they had to go back and we lost nothing&mdash;that is to say,
no money. We took Giuseppe and Maria to the Church
and had them married. Ugh! that wedding! The
priest made no jokes afterwards and coming out the
children threw stones.... I think I would have died
to make her happy; but as always happens, one could
do nothing."</p>

<p>"Were they unhappy together then?"</p>

<p>"They loved each other, but love is not happiness.
We can all get love. Love is nothing. Love
is everywhere since the death of Jesus Christ. I had
two people to work for now, for she was like him in
everything&mdash;one never knew which of them was speaking.
I had to sell our own boat and work under the
bad old man you have to-day. Worst of all, people
began to hate us. The children first&mdash;everything begins
with them&mdash;and then the women and last of all
the men. For the cause of every misfortune was&mdash;you
will not betray me?"</p>

<p>I promised good faith, and immediately he burst
into the frantic blasphemy of one who has escaped from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
supervision, cursing the priests, the lying filthy cheating
immoral priests who had ruined his life, who had murdered
his brother and the girl, whom he dared not murder
back because they held the key of heaven and could
ruin him in the next life too. "Thus are we tricked!"
was his cry and he stood up and kicked at the azure
ripples with his feet, till he had obscured them with a
cloud of sand.</p>

<p>I too was moved. The story of Giuseppe, for all
its absurdity and superstition, came nearer to reality than
anything I had known before. I don't know why, but
it filled me with desire to help others&mdash;the greatest of
all our desires I suppose, and the most fruitless. The
desire soon passed.</p>

<p>"She was about to have a child. That was the end
of everything. People said to me 'When will your
charming nephew be born? What a cheerful attractive
child he will be, with such a father and mother!' I
kept my face steady and replied 'I think he may be.
Out of sadness shall come gladness'&mdash;it is one of our
proverbs. And my answer frightened them very much,
and they told the priests, who were frightened too. Then
the whisper started that the child would be Anti-Christ:
you need not be afraid: he was never born.</p>

<p>"An old witch began to prophesy, and no one
stopped her. Giuseppe and the girl, she said, had silent
devils, who could do little harm. But the child would
always be speaking and laughing and perverting, and
last of all he would go into the sea and fetch up the
Siren into the air and all the world would see her and
hear her sing. As soon as she sang, the Seven Vials
would be opened and the Pope would die and Mongibello
flame, and the veil of Santa Agata would be burnt.
Then the boy and the Siren would marry, and together
they would rule the world, for ever and ever.</p>

<p>"The whole village was in tumult, and the hotel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
keepers became alarmed, for the tourist season was just
beginning. They met together and decided that Giuseppe
and the girl must be sent inland until the child
was born, and they subscribed the money. The night
before they were to start there was a full moon and wind
from the east, and all along the coast the sea shot up
over the cliffs in silver clouds. It is a wonderful sight,
and Maria said she must see it once more.</p>

<p>"'Do not go,' I said. 'I saw the priest go by,
and someone with him. And the hotel keepers do not
like you to be seen, and if we displease them also we
shall starve.'</p>

<p>"'I want to go,' she replied. 'The sea is stormy,
and I may never feel it again.'</p>

<p>"'No, he is right' said Giuseppe. 'Do not go&mdash;or
let one of us go with you.'</p>

<p>"'I want to go alone,' she said; and she went alone.</p>

<p>"I tied up their luggage in a piece of cloth, and
then I was so unhappy at thinking I should lose them
that I went and sat down by my brother and put my
arm round his neck, and he put his arm round me, which
he had not done for more than a year, and we remained
thus I don't remember how long.</p>

<p>"Suddenly the door flew open and moon-light and
wind came in together, and a child's voice said laughing
'They have pushed her over the cliffs into the sea.'</p>

<p>"I stepped to the drawer where I keep my knives,
and the child ran away.</p>

<p>"'Sit down again' said Giuseppe&mdash;Giuseppe of all
people! 'If she is dead, why should others die too?'</p>

<p>'I guess who it is,' I cried, 'and I will kill him.'</p>

<p>"I was almost out of the door but he tripped me up
and kneeling upon me took hold of both my hands and
sprained my wrists; first my right one, then my left. No
one but Giuseppe would have thought of such a thing. It
hurt more than you would suppose, and I fainted. When
I woke up, he was gone, and I have never seen him again."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
But Giuseppe disgusted me.</p>

<p>"I told you he was wicked," he said. "No one
would have expected him to see the Siren."</p>

<p>"How do you know he did see her then?"</p>

<p>"Because he did not see her 'often and often' but
once."</p>

<p>"Why do you love him if he is wicked?"</p>

<p>He laughed for the first time. That was his only
reply.</p>

<p>"Is that the end?" I asked, feeling curiously ashamed.</p>

<p>"I never killed her murderer, for by the time my
wrists were well, he was in America; and one cannot
kill a priest. As for Giuseppe, he went all over the
world too, looking for someone else who has seen the
Siren&mdash;either a man, or, better still, a woman, for then
the child might still have been born. At last he came
to Liverpool,&mdash;is the district probable?&mdash;and there he
began to cough, and spat blood until he died.</p>

<p>"I do not suppose there is anyone living now who
has seen her. There has seldom been more than one
in a generation, and never in my life will there be both
a man and a woman from whom that child can be born,
who will fetch up the Siren from the sea, and destroy
silence, and save the world!"</p>

<p>"Save the world?" I cried. "Did the prophecy
end like that?"</p>

<p>He leant back against the rock, breathing deep.
Through all the blue-green reflections I saw him colour.
I heard him say: "Silence and loneliness cannot last for
ever. It may be a hundred or a thousand years, but the
sea lasts longer, and she shall come out of it and sing."
I would have asked him more, but at that moment the
whole cave darkened, and there rode in through its
narrow entrance the returning boat.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
